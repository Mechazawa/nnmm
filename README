NAME
    nnmm - nnmm stands for nothing

SYNOPSIS 
    Python
        pasteurl = urllib2.urlopen("http://nnmm.nl/", <data>).read()
    Bash
        <command> | curl --data-urlencode @- "http://nnmm.nl/"
        curl --data-urlencode @- "http://nnmm.nl/" < <file>

DESCRIPTION
    Just post any data to this server and it'll give you a "paste" link.
    If the data is an url (ex "http://example.com/") it will return the
    same kind of url but it will instead be a shortened url. This means
    that it will redirect instead of show the data. This can be stopped 
    by adding an ! at the end of the url.

INSTALLING
    Change the database login etc in the index and apply the sql file 
    to the database. The file does not need any further configuration.
    It can be given any name and will automatically figure out the name
    and location of the script etc. Sqlite support is not hard to
    implement. It only requires the person installing it to change the 
    connection string to use sqlite and a sqlite database file containing
    the correct table structure.
