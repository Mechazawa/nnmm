NAME
    nnmm - nnmm stands for nothing

SYNOPSIS 
    Python
        pasteurl = urllib2.urlopen("https://nnmm.nl/", <data>).read()
    Bash
        <command> | curl --data-urlencode @- nnmm.nl

DESCRIPTION
    Just post any data to this page and it will give you a "paste" link.
    If the data is an url (ex "http://example.com/") it will return the
    same kind of url but it will instead be a shortened url. This means
    that it will redirect instead of show the data. This can be stopped 
    by adding a ! at the end of the url.
